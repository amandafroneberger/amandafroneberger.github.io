#Utilizing R Studio and Python!
In this class we've seen that R and Python are two different systems that can be used in order to make data manipulation easy and convienient. However, like they say- two is better than one! Why just use Python or R, when you can use both.

By using the reticulate function, R and Python are able to communicate with each other to work togther. Below I included an example of how these two systems communicate together in action!

This chunk of code is done in R and is important as it defines objects that can be retrieved in python. 

```{r}
library(reticulate)
we<-"Taylor Swift"

```
In the notation above, R is used to define the object "I" as Taylor Swift. This can be retrieved in python using r.notation, as seen below by putting "r.we"


```{python}
stan="is the g.o.a.t"
print(r.we,stan)

```


Conversely, you can also use a Python-defined object to retrieve an R code chunk by using "py$" notation. You can also see below that even though different code is used, the same message is produced as above!


```{r}
cat(c(we,py$stan))
```
