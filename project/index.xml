      <description>Project 1 This analysis looks at the correlation between alcohol consumption and average measure of happiness per country and continent.
Introduction: For this project I decided to combine two datasets in order to find if there is a correlation between happiness and alcohol consumption by country. The first dataset I found looks at the average happiness score on a scale of 1 to 10 per country, while also looking at other social factors like, GDP per capita, and social support that could offer potential correlations to the overall happiness level.</description>

      <description>Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (preferably HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on the due date. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., donâ€™t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>
