      <description>Project 1 This analysis looks at the correlation between alcohol consumption and average measure of happiness per country and continent.
Introduction: For this project I decided to combine two datasets in order to find if there is a correlation between happiness and alcohol consumption by country. The first dataset I found looks at the average happiness score on a scale of 1 to 10 per country, while also looking at other social factors like, GDP per capita, and social support that could offer potential correlations to the overall happiness level.</description>
